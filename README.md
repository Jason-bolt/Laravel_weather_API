# Weather Incident API

## A simple API to make use of calling external APIs and working with Resources and Requests classes in Laravel

The API takes the name, country and city information in the form of json. Then uses the city data to query a [weather API](https://openweathermap.org/current). The temperature, humidity and  wind speed data are retrieved from the weather API and attached to the payload which is then stored in the MySQL database.

## Technologies Used
- Laravel
- MySQL
